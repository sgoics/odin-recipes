        <p>How to make Simple Spaghetti Fra Diavolo with just a handful of simple ingredients! This spicy Italian pasta recipe is always a crowd-pleaser!<br>
            It’s no secret we love pasta! But this easy spaghetti fra diavolo is definitely one of the most made (and loved) pasta recipes in our household. It’s simple, saucy, and SPICY! And we almost always have the ingredients needed on hand. Especially in the Summer when our herb garden is in full bloom.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>10 cloves garlic, sliced very thin or minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes<br> (add a little more if you really like the spice!)</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups tomato puree</li>
            <li>1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound of spaghetti, cooked al dente</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes. Add ground beef and increase heat to medium-high. Cook until the meat begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Lower heat to low and add marinara sauce. If you want the lasagna to be extra saucy, I suggest adding more sauce. Let the sauce continue to simmer.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h3>Paremesan Ricotta Cheese Filling:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, egg, basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Spread the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan with ¼ cup of the meat sauce. Place 3 noodles in a single layers on top of the sauce. Spread each noodle with parmesan ricotta cheese filling and sprinkle with 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and meat sauce. Repeat. Finish with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking spray and cover the lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and then remove the foil. Continue to bake until the cheese if bubbling, about 25 minutes longer. Cool the lasagna for 10 minutes before cutting into pieces</li>
        </ol>
