        <p>The Best Chicken Parmesan recipe, made a bit healthier! Breaded chicken cutlets are baked, not fried yet the chicken is so moist and full of flavor.<br>
        If you want to know how to make an easy chicken parmesan that doesn’t require deep frying, you came to the right place! This easy chicken dinner is delicious and healthy, 
            <br>the whole family will love it! It’s breaded and baked in the oven, then topped with my homemade marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese. Serve it over pasta, zucchini noodles, 
            <br>roasted veggies or with a large salad to keep it on the lighter side. For an air fryer version check out my air fryer chicken parmesan recipe.</p>
